            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>It's time for something new.  
                My work history began in finance and transitioned to IT several years later.  To be honest, never in a 
                million years would I have thought I'd end up in tech, but looking back, there were signs.
                <br>  
                As a kid, I remember taking gadgets apart that were lying around the house because I was 
                curious to see how things worked.  Even though there’s nothing particularly interesting 
                about the innards of a remote control, I loved seeing what’s on the inside.  
                <br>  Later on, I was bitten by the creative bug and developed a taste to express my creative side. I wrote 
                poems and short stories in my spare time.  As I write this, now I’m wondering how I got into finance.
                <br> 
                After working in finance for a few years, it got boring and mundane; I hated it!   I saw 
                an advertisement on the train for an IT program and gave it a try.  I loved it in the 
                beginning and now I’m ready for another transition.  I recently took a bootcamp course 
                and began learning front and back-end technologies.  It wasn’t easy.  I learned in 6 months 
                what some developers learn over 20 years, but I stuck with the program as it got more 
                and more challenging because I started to love it! I see the potential for something great.  
                I’m eager to work for an employer that will cultivate my talents and create a space where 
                I can continue learning to improve my craft.
